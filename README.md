### WARNING: alpha software

I keep placing these warnings in code and everywhere else but playing with `tc` 
and `iptables` is no joke and this program has the potential to shut the
lights out on your machine when it comes to internet traffic of course.
 
## Why this package
I was in need of a simple method of applying some rules to enforce limits on
connected clients for one of my proxy servers. Apparently I had some clients
abusing the system and consuming the entire bandwidth leaving everybody else
in the 90s

I did search for a few hours and found nothing simple enough to do the job
without me having to study its documentation for years.
